1.Conduct research to understand how HTTP applications preserve the state of an application across multiple request-response cycles, especially concerning user authentication and session management. Write a paragraph describing your findings.
HTTP, as a fundamentally stateless protocol, necessitates specific techniques to preserve application state across multiple request-response cycles, particularly in managing user authentication and sessions. Upon successful authentication—often via credentials submitted in an initial login request—the server generates a unique session identifier (session ID), which is transmitted to the client as a cookie in the response header; this cookie is then automatically included in subsequent requests, enabling the server to map the ID to stored session data (such as user roles, preferences, or shopping cart contents) maintained in server-side mechanisms like in-memory caches, databases, or distributed stores. This server-side session approach ensures seamless continuity of the user's authenticated state without redundant logins, while security best practices, including secure (HTTPS-only) and HttpOnly flags on cookies, help mitigate risks like interception or cross-site scripting attacks. For more scalable or stateless alternatives, token-based systems like JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) encode authentication claims directly into self-contained, signed tokens that clients present with each request, allowing verification without server-side lookups but introducing trade-offs in token size and revocation complexity (Packetlabs, 2022; Stytch, 2024; Auth0, n.d.).

2. Investigate and document the procedures for performing Django database migrations to a server-based relational database like MariaDB. Write a paragraph describing your findings.


Performing Django database migrations to a server-based relational database like MariaDB involves a straightforward workflow that ensures schema changes from models are safely propagated to the production environment. Once configured, generate migration files by running python manage.py makemigrations, which detects model changes and creates Python files describing the alterations in the migrations directory of each app. (docs.djangoproject.com) Finally, apply the migrations to the remote MariaDB instance with python manage.py migrate, which executes the operations atomically to update the schema, create tables, add fields, or handle data migrations as needed; this command also initializes Django's internal django_migrations table to track applied changes. (docs.djangoproject.com) For production servers, it's advisable to run migrations in a controlled manner, such as during deployments, and enable MySQL's strict mode to prevent data truncation issues during insertions.
